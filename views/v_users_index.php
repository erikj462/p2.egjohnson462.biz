                    CNBC can be helpful with attempting to gain a grasp on market direction for any particular day. There studies are mostly for the stock market but with indebt study a trader can match individual sectors with individual futures. For Example: When the Dow Jones average goes up then oil usually rises and the dollar index falls.

                As crazy as it may sound the weather is a big indicator for the Futures Market. Let Me give a few real world examples that have happened this year. In a trader had been watching the weather patterns from last year they would have noticed that the winter in certain areas was uncharacteristically warm. This could cause Natural Gas prices to fall since people that use Natural gas as their heat source are not using the supply creating a glut. A different example on how watching the weather could bring profits is, if the trader had been watching the temperatures in mid America and noticed the a spike in temperatures and invested in the agricultural market they would have gained a healthy profit from the drought that took place.
